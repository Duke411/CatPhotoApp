# CatPhotoApp
Learning the basics of Html through this project 'CatPhotoApp'

This project is one of many in the FreeCodeCamp curriculum designed to help me practice basic HTML and HTML5 skills. In this project, i was  tasked with creating a simple web page that displays a cat photo. i used HTML and HTML5 elements to structure the page and add an image tag to display the cat photo.
